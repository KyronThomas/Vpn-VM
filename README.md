# VPNs - IP Configurations & Network Tunnels

## Virtual Private Network (VPN) Exploration Project

This project dives into the world of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and explores how they can manipulate the information you receive from services like YouTube and Netflix. The core functionality of a VPN is to reroute your internet traffic through another network, essentially masking your real IP address and making it appear as though you're accessing the internet from another location.

VPNs enable you to bypass regional restrictions, making content from other countries accessible. This project demonstrates how VPNs change IP addresses and facilitate access to media that would otherwise be unavailable due to geographical limitations.

### Key Demonstration: Changing Media Availability

As part of the demonstration, I will showcase how changing your IP address can unlock content from regions such as Russia, allowing you to access YouTube content that might not be available in the United States.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Azure Virtual Machines:** Employed for setting up virtual environments for VPN usage.
- **Google Chrome Extensions (VPN Tools):** These extensions make it simple to change the region your internet traffic appears to come from.
- **Vpn free.pro:** A free VPN service used to test various network locations and their impact on streaming media.

### What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and another network over the internet. This "tunnel" protects your online activity from hackers, advertisers, and even your internet service provider.

By changing your IP address, VPNs allow you to mask your real location and appear as if you're browsing from a different country. This feature is crucial for accessing content restricted to specific regions and for maintaining online privacy.

### Why Use a VPN?

Have you ever tried to access a video or stream a show, only to be greeted with a "This content is unavailable in your region" message? VPNs allow you to bypass these restrictions by virtually changing your location. For example, with a VPN, you can watch Russian YouTube content from anywhere in the world. VPNs also help keep your online data safe from tracking and malicious activity.

### Demonstration Images

Below are some screenshots from my VPN demonstration, showing the changes in region and how they impact available content:

This project demonstrates how VPNs can fundamentally change the way we interact with digital content by bypassing regional restrictions and enhancing online privacy. For example, when connected through the American IP address 48.217.85.145, YouTube displays English titles and content trending in the United States. Additionally, Netflix is fully accessible, offering its U.S.-based library.

In contrast, when switching to a Russian IP address such as 45.134.12.131, the experience changes dramatically. YouTube content appears in Russian, showcasing region-specific trends, while Netflix becomes unavailable due to service restrictions placed on Russian IPs.

These examples highlight how different IP addresses can completely reshape your digital environment. By masking your true location, VPNs not only unlock region-locked media but also make it more difficult for trackers and advertisers to consistently monitor your online activity, as your digital identity keeps shifting across borders.
